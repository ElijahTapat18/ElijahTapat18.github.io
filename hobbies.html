    <h2>Outside of School</h2>
</div>

    <h5>Outside of school I enjoy spending a lot of my freetime doing things that I love. Whenever I complete all of my important tasks that I was assgined in school, I play video games to clear my mind off of the stress so that my mental health won't plumit. Aside from that, I do enjoy spending a lot in my free time doing creative things like playing the guitar and cooking. These creative hobbies that I do help me find value in my life and to seek out the brighter side of me. </h5>

    <div class="container1">
        <h3 class="header1">This is me plyaing my electric guitar and recording one of my first successful covers that I have shared on Instagram. Playing songs and enjoying my creative pieces have embraced myself as a person and playing my guitar is what helps me thrive more in my life.</h3>

        <h3 class="header1">this is a soufle omlet that I have made myself multiple times whenever I have eggs laying around in my fridge. I have learned how to make this omlet multiple times and the first attemptes were not fluffy like this one. It took me many tires to perfect this dish, and finally doing it made me realize how practice makes improvements. </h3>
