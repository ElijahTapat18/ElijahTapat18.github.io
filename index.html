      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <br>
      <h5>I strive for self-efficacy. I am someone who wants put myself out there to master various experiences that my techology knowledge take me. I can hold responsiblities that I can greatly prove my hard work. </h5>
      <br>
      <h5>I am someone who has taken a huge interest and passion in computers and music. Ever since the Covic-19 pandemic has started, I have always wanted been craving something hands on to maintain my learning in anything. That is when I started watching people build computers. I've watched Youtubers creating their own gaming pc, and I have watched and learned what each component does in a pc. This has sparked my love in computers because of how hands on it can help me engange, and to master the art of builing a computer with all of it's compnents. As for music, I got my first instrument when I was 14 years old, it was a Ukulele, and it has helped me through the lowest of my life. music has alwasy been a calming factor for when I am feeling sad, but playing music and creating my own music better improves my feelings and helps me destress. Both of these passions deal with hands on work, and in the end, I want to advance foward for both of these passions. I would like to become a computer builder and becoming a Computer Informational Analyst, and I want to hone my skills in string instruments to own a electric guitar. I have the drivin confidence and willingness in myself that I will achieve my goals. </h5>
